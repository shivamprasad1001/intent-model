# AIDesktopAssistant

## Overview

AIDesktopAssistant is a modular, intelligent desktop assistant that understands and executes natural language commands using custom-trained **Intent Classification** and **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** models. It can perform tasks like launching apps, setting reminders, controlling media, and managing system functions.

This assistant is fully offline, customizable, and designed to work across platforms ‚Äî making it a powerful personal productivity tool for your desktop.

> **Project Started:** 8th June 2025  
> **Status:** Actively under development

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivamprasad1001/AIDesktopAssistant.git
cd AIDesktopAssistant
```
2. Configure your data:

* Setup your custom entity tags and logic inside `nlu/`.

---

## Training the Models

This assistant uses **custom-trained NLU models**. Train them via the companion repo:

### Intent Model:

‚û° [Train intent model using this repository](https://github.com/shivamprasad1001/intent-model)

### NER Model:

‚û° (Soon!!)

Once trained:

* Save your intent model inside `nlu/`
* Save your NER model inside `nlu/simple_ner_model`

---

## Usage

Start the assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```

Speak or type commands such as:

* **"Open Chrome"** ‚Üí Launches app
* **"Set a reminder for 9 PM to study"** ‚Üí Adds to `reminders.json`
* **"Play some music"** ‚Üí Triggers media module

The assistant will:

1. Classify intent
2. Extract entities
3. Route to the correct module
4. Execute the command
